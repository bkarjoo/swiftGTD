# Testing Task Toggle Functionality

## Current Status
We have added comprehensive logging throughout the application to diagnose why task toggling isn't working.

## How to Test

1. **Open the iOS Simulator**
   - The app should already be running (SwiftGTD)
   - If not, run: `xcrun simctl launch 85942F58-E9E5-444B-AF75-E2177C45343A com.behrooz.SwiftGTD1`

2. **Navigate to a Task**
   - In the app, find any task (items with circle icons)
   - Tasks are distinguishable from folders by their circle icon (instead of folder icon)

3. **Click the Task Checkbox**
   - Click directly on the circle icon next to a task
   - This should toggle the task between completed/uncompleted

4. **Check the Console Output**
   Run this command to see the logs:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl spawn 85942F58-E9E5-444B-AF75-E2177C45343A log show --last 2m | grep -E "TreeNodeView|TreeViewModel|DataManager|APIClient" | grep -E "toggle|Task|checkbox"
   ```

## Expected Log Flow

When you click a task checkbox, you should see logs in this order:

1. `ðŸ”˜ [TreeNodeView] Task checkbox clicked for node: <id> - <title>`
2. `ðŸ“ž [TreeNodeView] Current completion status: <true/false>`
3. `ðŸ“ž [TreeNodeView.onToggleTaskStatus] Calling with node: <title>`
4. `ðŸ“ž [TreeViewModel.toggleTaskStatus] Called with node: <id> - <title>`
5. `ðŸ“ž [TreeViewModel.toggleTaskStatus] DataManager available: true`
6. `ðŸ“ž [DataManager.toggleNodeCompletion] Called with node: <id> - '<title>'`
7. `ðŸ“ž [APIClient.toggleTaskCompletion] Called`
8. API request/response logs...
9. `âœ… [DataManager.toggleNodeCompletion] Returning updated node`
10. `âœ… [TreeViewModel.toggleTaskStatus] Updated node in array`

## Troubleshooting

If the logs stop at any point, that's where the issue is occurring. The logging will show exactly where in the chain the problem happens.

## Current Issue

Based on the user's report, clicking the checkbox causes the tree to reload but doesn't actually toggle the task status. The logs will reveal where this is failing.
